INTRO:

Endora: Hey there! My name's Endora. So, I should probably explain why you're
here. I'm from the planet Vurx, which exists in the distant future -
approximately 10^100 of your years in the future, to be exact. Our species had a
bit of an accident, you could say. I was in a research lab when one of my
coworkers finally figured out how to resolve... I think they're called
Relativistic and Quantum physics in your language? The problem is, his proof for
it actually resulted in a paradox that started destroying the universe.

TUTORIAL:

Endora: This here is your own personal drone! 

ENDING:

Endora: Nice going! You helped save the multiverse! Well, if I'm being honest,
I could totally have done it without you. It's easy enough to make these drones
autonomous, you know. But hey, you still had fun, right? Anyway, I'm going to
disconnect you from the actual drones now. Everything you do from here on out
will 



LOOT BOXES:

Endora: So I have a bit of a confession to make. I used to have a huge scat
fetish.
